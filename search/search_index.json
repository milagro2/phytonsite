I also made my first contribution. I did that using this tutorial . The first thing I did was to fork that repository by clicking the fork button. By doing this it created a copy of the repo into my account. I than went to my account, opened the forked repo and clicked on a code where I clicked on the 'copy to clipboard' icon. I opened a terminal in Visual Studios Code and put in this code: git clone \"https://github.com/milagro2/first-contributions.git\" With that I copied the contents of that repo to my pc (to VS-Code). Then I this to get to the right directory: cd first-contributions Than to create a new branch I used this: git switch -c ContBranch I then opened the Contributors.md in VS-code, put my name somewhere in the middle and used git status to see the changes I made. To add those changes to the branch and commit and push I used these commands: git add Contributors.md git commit -m \"Add Moreno to Contributors list\" git push -u origin ContBranch After that I went to the repo, clicked on the Pull request , then on the Compare and pull request button and finaly on the Create pull request to submit it all. Now the changes should get merged into the main branch.","title":"Project 1 - Github / First Open Source Contribution"},{"location":"project1/#project-1-github-first-open-source-contribution","text":"For the first project, I learned a bit more about Github and how to use it.

I used this tutorial . The first thing I did was open Python and run this command in the terminal: pip install mkdocs Next I ran this command to create a new project: mkdocs new my-poject cd my-project Then I used mkdocs serve to get the server running and when I went to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in my browser where it displayed the MkDocs website. By going into the mkdocs.yml file I could change the site_name which was immediately visible in the browser. This is what the mkdocs.yml looks like: site_name: Python Projects site_url: https://pythonprojects.com/ nav: - Home: index.md - Agile: https://milagro2.github.io./Agile.html - Projects: - Project 1 - Github / First Open Source Contribution: project1.md - Project 2 - Python site with MkDocs: project2.md - Project 3 - File name convention checker: project3.md - Project 4 - Variable name convention checker: project4.md theme: material Its easy to add pages and sub-pages in the nav. For the theme I first put this command in the terminal: pip install mkdocs-material And wrote material behind theme in mkdocs.yml. MkDocs comes with two built in themes: mkdocs and readthedocs but I found more themes made by other people here . I then used this to build a documentation: mkdocs build To look inside the directory I used: $ ls site And thats how i made this website using Python and MkDocs.","title":"Project 2 - Python site with MkDocs"},{"location":"project2/#project-2-python-site-with-mkdocs","text":"For project 2 I learned how to make this website using MkDocs.
