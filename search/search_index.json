I also made my first contribution. I did that using this tutorial.</p> <p>The first thing I did was to fork that repository by clicking the <code>fork</code> button. By doing this it created a copy of the repo into my account. I than went to my account, opened the forked repo and clicked on a <code>code</code> where I clicked on the 'copy to clipboard' icon. I opened a terminal in Visual Studios Code and put in this code:</p> <pre><code>git clone \"https://github.com/milagro2/first-contributions.git\"\n</code></pre> <p>With that I copied the contents of that repo to my pc (to VS-Code).  Then I this to get to the right directory:</p> <pre><code>cd first-contributions\n</code></pre> <p>Than to create a new branch I used this:</p> <pre><code>git switch -c ContBranch\n</code></pre> <p>I then opened the Contributors.md in VS-code, put my name somewhere in the middle and used <code>git status</code> to see the changes I made.  To add those changes to the branch and commit and push I used these commands:</p> <pre><code>git add Contributors.md\n\ngit commit -m \"Add Moreno  to Contributors list\"\n\ngit push -u origin ContBranch\n</code></pre> <p>After that I went to the repo, clicked on the <code>Pull request</code>, then on the <code>Compare and pull request</code> button and finaly on the <code>Create pull request</code> to submit it all.  Now the changes should get merged into the main branch.</p>"},{"location":"project2/","title":"Project 2 - Phyton site with MkDocs","text":"<p>I made this website using MkDocs.
