#project 1
In project 1 I wrote a Python script that reads all the filenames and checks if the name is correct or not. The name is correct when it has a specific word in front of it. Than it makes a list of 'good_files' and 'bad_files' and gives an error so you know which file names to fix.
  - heres the code: blah
