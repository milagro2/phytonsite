During my internship I worked togheter with Petrus Jacobus van der Walt (Kobus). He is a [DevOps](https://milagro2.github.io./DevOps.html) Engineer for Gall&Gall.
We worked on a couple different projects.

In project 1 I learned how to make a pull request which was my first contribution. I also learned more about GitHub in general.
