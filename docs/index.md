During my internship I worked togheter with Petrus Jacobus van der Walt (Kobus). He is a [DevOps](https://milagro2.github.io./DevOps.html) Engineer for Gall&Gall.
We worked on a couple different projects.

In project 1 I learned how to make a pull request which was my first contribution. I also learned more about GitHub in general. This is what it looks like when its approved and merged:

In project 2 I learned how to make this website using MkDocs in Python. This is what the mkdocs.yml (the structure of the website) looks like:

In project 3 wrote a script that checks all the files in a folder and than tells if the names are written correct or not. This is what the script looks like:
<br>

In project 4 I wrote a script that takes the JSON Objects from all the files and than shows if all the variables are defined correctly or not. This is what the script looks like:

In the last one, project 5 I learned a lot about fastAPI in Python, Docker and Railway. I created something that can take a image, check for faces and than verify the age of that person. This is the result:
