# Project 3 - File name convention checker

In project 3, I wrote a Python script that reads all the filenames and checks if the name is correct or not. The name is correct when it has a specific word in front of it. Then it makes a list of 'good_files' and 'bad_files' and gives an error so you know which file names to fix.
